## Survey form with React
A survey form bulit using React. Focus in the project was to practice React state and controlled forms, using components. The project consists of 4 questions and when submitted, a summary of all the answers is shown. Questions are shown one at a time and the user needs to answer each question to be able to continue to the next question. Form elements used are text input, checkboxes, radiobuttons and a select-dropdown.
This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp.

## The process
I made one component per question/input type and one generic button. The Survey-component takes in all the other components. And the app-component renders the Survey. In the survey-component I made a function to show one question at a time and then a summary with the answers when the submit-button is clicked. Lastly I did the styling, responsiveness and checked accessibility. 

## Tech Used
